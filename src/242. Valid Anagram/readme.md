Given two strings _`s`_ and _`t`_, return _`true`_ if _`t`_ is an anagram of _`s`_, and _`false`_ otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- [x] `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- [x] `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
